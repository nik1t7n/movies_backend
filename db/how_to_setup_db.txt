Download ml-latest (big) dataset from this link:
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

Extract archive in the "data" folder. All CSVs must be inside
Then uncomment this code in main.py file:
```
# try:
#     initialize_database()
# except Exception as e:
#     raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Database error: {str(e)}")
```

Run app - everything should be fine ^_^
